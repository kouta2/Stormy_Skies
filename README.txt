Welcome to StormySkies:

About: StormySkies is a web application to help visualize daily and severe weather. For now, there is only data for the United States and there is only daily data from 1950 - 2015. The website is currently not being hosted anywhere but to get an idea of what the website does, take a look at the demo.mp4 video file!

Features:
	Home Page(Lightning Bolt): On the home page, you can read a brief summary of what StormySkies is about. Along with that, there is a widget to tell you the current temperature in your area and there is a picture carousel of different severe weather.

	Queries Page: The queries page has 4 different types of ways to query the data. You can query by year, date, fatalities, and rating. The first three in that list interface with google maps. The annual page allows the user to type in a year and receive all of the severe weather that happened that year in the US. The Date page allows the user to query by a date and specify the severe weather he is interested in. If the user does not specify a date, the daily weather for the date is plotted. Different severe weathers are color cordinated according to the colors to the left of the map and daily weather stations are color coordinated based off of temperature with the scale on the right of the map. Next on the fatalities page, a user can type in a range of fatalities and specify the type of severe weather he is interested in. States that are a darker red indicate more occurences of that type of severe weather in that area. Finally, in the ratings page, a user can specify a range of scale for a particular severe weather and will receive the severe weather information in table form.

	Playback Page: The playback page allows the user to visualize the change of temperature over time for a given year. When the user types in a year, a loading bar at the bottom of the page indicates where we are in that year and as time goes by, the weather stations start to change color. Towards the middle of the loading bar (May - Aug) you will see the weather stations start to become warmer and at the start of the bar and end of the bar (Jan - Feb and Nov - Dec) the weather stations will be colder colors.

	Add Data Page: The add data page allows anyone to insert relevant data into the database. This feature would be one way to allow the data in the database to be up to date.
